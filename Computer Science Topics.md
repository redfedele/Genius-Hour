#Computer Science Topics

##Enviromental

Many companies and groups in Canada and elsewhere have taken great precautions to encourage environmental stewardship and promote programs and practices that support sustainability. Environment Canada is a major corporation tasked to help deal with environmental issues concerning Canada. One of the initiatives they undertook was a program called the "Chemical Management Plan". Adopted under the "Canadian Environmental Protection Act" of 1999, the "Chemical Management Plan" strives to protect Canadians and the environment around us by assessing various chemicals commonly found in electronic waste, then determining whether or not the chemical has to have any restrictions placed on it. Furthermore, the Canadian government keeps a keen eye on any waste crossing international and interprovincial borders to ensure that proper safety precautions and proper handling are used when transporting this waste. Another great program undertaken by the city of Mississauga is battery recycling. It not uncommon to see battery recycling bins placed in community centres and libraries where citizens may throw out there used batteries in order to ensure the right measures are taken to recycle the battery components.


##Ethics

Piracy is a very common ethical issue related to computers which may take a toll on the economy, and could get you thrown in jail. Piracy,in terms of computer use, means to download (most likely a torrent in this case) someone else's content (this could be software, music, movies etc.) without paying when it would usually cost you money. Not only is this illegal, but is also morally wrong.Some of the cons of piracy are; 1. A high chance of accidently downloading a computer virus, 2. Piracy is stealing money from artists and software producers, 3. It negatively affects the economy by taking away money that could have been put to good use. Although there are many cons to pirating software illegally, there are also some pros; 1. Purchasing software may be too expensive for some people who really need it, 2. Piracy may give the torrenter a good idea of what a software is like in the future, and they may purchase it in the future. One interesting fact about piracy is that Canada has one of the lowest rates of piracy in the world (35%), although, piracy iCanadada still cost companies around $890 million canadian dollars in 2014, a 15% increase from the previous year (CAAST, 2015). 


##Emerging Technology

Emerging tech is defined as a technology that is currently being developed or developed in the next decade, although it is not available to be used by the general public yet. One of the many emerging technologies is "Arcologies". Arcologies are human habitable places that take are designed to have low/no impact on the environment and is self-sustainable (no outside help required). This means that the facility would be able to generate its own food supply, housing, businesses, and water supply. The idea of an "Arcology" was developed by a man named, "Paolo Soleri". Born in 1919, Paola Soleri was a renowned Italian architect that would eventually create the idea of an Arcology. The first prototype of an Arcology started its development in Arizona during the early 70's. Although the development of the first arcology started quite a long time ago (46 years), the site is constantly being developed and added onto therefore keeping its title as an "Emerging Technology". In addition to the Arizona site, there are 4 other Arcologies being developed worldwide in; Abu Dhabi, Moscow, Las Vegas, and Antartica. It is thought that in the coming years Arcologies will become a more wide-spread concept and more of them will be built.


##Collaborative Research

Computer science goes hand in hand with many other areas of research including, Biology, Physics, Sociology, and much more. One of the biggest fields that computer science applies to is geology. The goal of geology is to research earth, what it is made of, and what processes take a toll on the composition of it. One of the main areas of geology where computer science can be applied to is is geologic modeling. Geologic modeling is the process in where computers are used to make representations of sections of the earth's and observe how certain processes affect it. For example; a software called "Geomodeller3D" is a program produced by BDSM and Intrepid Geophysics that produces 3D models of the earth. It does this by using data obtained from seismic events and geological processes such as convection and magnetism and creating it into images that are then layered together to form a whole picture. This program was written in various programming languages such as such as C++, Java, and XML.  The first stable release date of this program was March 3, 2013, meaning it's fairly new as these programs take a long time to develop.

##Theoretical Computer Science

In computer science, there are many theoretical subjects that people are still trying to wrap there heads aroudn in order to apply it to normal computer science. One of the many theorys is called "Automata Theory". This theory is the study of Automata (a self operating machine) and abstract machines. The main objective of the Automata theory is to construct ways in which programmers may be able to anailyze the dynamic behaviour of discrete systems (as sytem with a low number of states). Automata would work by allowing someone to design a computer that automatically follows a series of predetermined operations. This theory may be used to develop AI, interaction between humans and computers, cosmology, financial analysis, and much more.
