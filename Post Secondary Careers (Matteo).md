## Post Secondary Careers Assignment (Software Engineering)

###What is Software Engineering
There are many positive aspects of software engineering that may attract people towards this career path , I will be going over three of them. The first and one of the most important aspects of this career is its payment. Software engineers earn 67,213 dollars annually, that's just over 18,500 dollars more than the average salary in Ontario! Furthermore, software engineers may earn up to 140,000 dollars annually if they stick around long enough. Another appealing benefit of software engineering is that it comes with a lot of benefits such as healthcare, a lot of paid holidays, and full retirement plans. This allows for more money to be saved, and more free time. Although there are many pros of software engineering, there are negative ones as well. One con of software engineering is the hours. Software engineers typically work 50 hours a week. This could lead to fatigue and stress, which in turn could lead to more serious conditions. Another con is the amount of memorization and learning that engineers have to go through in order to do well in their field. In addition to University, there are more things you will learn on the job.
	
###Universities that Offer Courses that Lead Into Software Engineering
Waterloo and McMaster offer's programs that will help you achieve a career in the software engineering field. The first program that I will be going over is McMasters software engineering program. This course offers the necessary experience to build, maintain,and design software. To enter this program, one would need to take at least six grade 12 university or mixed courses, and score an average of 80% or higher. In addition to these high school prerequisites, one must take a "Common level One program" that includes math, physics, chemistry, and more (this course is offered at the university). The average cost for this program would be 48,812 dollars for four years. Waterloos program is a four-year computer science program that focuses more on coding and learning different types of languages. The prerequisites for this program is pretty much the same as McMasters only it isn't necessary for one to take the "Common Level one program". The cost for Waterloo is 55,631 dollars (four years). You may choose Waterloo over McMasters due to Waterloos prestige as one of the best universities in Canada. On the other hand you may choose McMasters due to its lower cost and more in-depth look at software engineering.
