# Genius Hour for Fall 2016
Location to log my genius hour work and learning.  This readme will be updated as a log file for the project, and any data files (if necessary) will be found within the repo. 

##Topic
* For Genius Hour, I will be teaching myself how to create electronic music, A.K.A. EDM. I will accomplish this by using a program called "Fruity Loops". Fruity loops is a music creation software that many EDM Producers use in order to make and remix songs. I will dedicate at least an hour each week to learn the program, and eventually will create a song (or two) from what I have learned.

####Week 1 (Sept 18 - 24)
* The first thing I did was download and install fruity loops. When I first launched it I found it to be very intimidating due to the large amount of unfimiliar items on the screen. I watched half of an hour long  [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_3849302035&feature=iv&src_vid=K5lGR4hQoBw&v=NU3Yi9zqYas) to help me understand the complicated layout and what the basics features do. Some of the things the tutorial went over are; how to create simple beats, record various instrument types, and how to loop sounds together.  Although the tutorial did give a lot of explanation on what I should know as a beginner, there is still alot to learn. 

####Week 2 (Sept 25 - Oct 1)
* This week I watched the rest of the video and tried to grasp more of the basic concepts. The rest of the video explained how to properly combine sounds, how to change beats and rhythms depending on what you want to do, and how to install useful plugins and sound libraries. After this I realized that I would probably need to learn notes and use a piano keyboard properly, this is in order to use the correct notes and make it easier on myself in the future. Although I have gone over the tutorials and learned the notes on a keyboard, I do not think I will be able to start just yet.
