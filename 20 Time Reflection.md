#20 Time Reflection

##What have I learned?

            I have learned many things during thisproject, the most obvious being the basics of Fruity Loops Studio, and simple musicproduction skills. Some of the more important things that I learned with thisproject, as mentioned in the presentation, is time management skills. For mostof my life, time management and procrastination has been a real problem for me.This project helped me to understand the importance of getting work done intime, and not stressing it until the last minute.

 

##What more is there to learn, for you, in regards to this project?

            I really have only learned thebasics of electronic music production, and do not have the full experiencenecessary to create actual tracks, so one of the main focuses if I were toreturn to this project is learning piano. Musical instruments, especially thepiano/keyboard, are a major component because you have to learn how to producesounds based of these instruments in a digital environment. Another thing thatis to learn is how to get my music out there and publicized, although I probablywouldn’t bother as I would do it for my own amusement.

##What did you think of the process?

            I thought the process was verydifferent from other school projects. What I mean by this is that you more orless work on your own time and there is no set requirements. In other subjects youwould have to hand in a specific degree of work in order to get the mark, inthis case you only have to do what is possible as long as you tried. Also, theschedule is flexible as it is drawn out in a long period, and a minimal amountof time spent on the project itself. All in all, it was an enjoyable experiencethat was a refresh from other “main stream” assignments.

 

##What would you do differently if you had the opportunity?

            The only thing that I would do differently is spend more time on the project. I put this project at the bottom of my priority’s in terms of school work as the class was given a lot of time to work on it, but thetime runs out quickly if you keep delaying it. So I think I would have madesome more room for this project during the time’s that I normally work.
